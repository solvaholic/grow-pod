Grow food in trash!

## Why is this important to me?
I'd like to know, from experience, that it's possible for anyone to start growing their own food.

## How, generally, would I like to achieve this?
Define modular, scalable, repeatable, re-usable solutions for growing:
- Small greens like Lettuce, Green Onion, and Herbs
- Small fruits like Strawberries
- Medium fruits like Peppers, Tomatoes, and Cucumbers

Emphasize low barrier to entry, low cost, and sustainability.

## What steps will make it happen?
1. Make and/or use a solution; Take effective notes
1. Evaluate the solution; Consider improvements
1. Repeat

## Assumptions
- People have, or have access to, reusable food-safe containers
- People have, or have access to, water suitable for plants
- People have, or have access to, seeds, growing media, and plant food
