To get started growing something, anything, I want to make it convenient and as simple as possible while guaranteeing success. I need to see something grow, and eat it.

AeroGarden is fantastic for this: For about USD $150 I got a 6-pod countertop hydroponic garden and all the supplies I'd need.

# How it works
The Harvest is made of 3 plastic parts: A base containing the power supply and light, a basin to hold the pump and water, and a top to hold the plants.

The Harvest comes with several pre-seeded grow pods that're guaranteed to sprout, as well as the required nutrient solution.

Initial setup:
1. Unpack everything, check it, clean off any odd tape, plastic, or foam bits
1. Put the basin on the base; Put the top on the basin
1. Install the seed pods you'd like to grow
1. Fill the basin with water, to the marked level
1. Add the prescribed amount of nutrient solution to the basin, about 1/2 Tbsp or 8 mL
1. Connect the power supply to the base

That's it! Well, almost: Ensure the light schedule starts and stops at times that work for you, and your environment. Check the documentation for instructions on how to set the start time.

From here there are four maintenance tasks:
- Check the basin each 3-7 days and fill the water up to the marked level
- Replace the water in the basin every 4 weeks (the Harvest will remind you)
- Add nutrient solution every 2 weeks (the Harvest will remind you)
- Eat the food you're growing!

# Like
This is fast, simple, low-maintenance, and just works.

You can put any seeds you want in it: Re-use the plastic baskets and provide a suitable grow medium.

So far, favorites in our household are: Red oak leaf lettuce, sweet basil, thyme, and dill.

# Dislike
The platform is too small for lettuce and salad greens. Like, greens will grow really well in it, but...

The bottoms of the plants get yucky when they stay wet. If you have a bunch of lettuce blocking light and airflow around the bottoms of your plants, they're likely to rot.

The plants taste like I want but are too tender. I think this is a common risk with indoor hydroponics: Need to keep a fan blowing the leaves, or something, to encourage the plants to toughen up.
